            <h1>Welcome To</h1>
            <h1><span>Samiya's </span>World</h1>
            <p>In 2007, I joined the faculty in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University. From 2001 to
                2006, I also taught in the CS department at Stanford as a Lecturer. From 2002-2007, I was a full-time
                Senior Research Scientist at Google. After moving to Stanford, I continued to consult at Google
                part-time until 2010. My research interests include computer science education, machine learning, and
                information retrieval on the Web. Please see my publications web page for more information.
                Previously, I worked for several years as a Senior Engineering Manager at Epiphany. Prior to working at
                Epiphany, I completed my PhD in the Computer Science Department at Stanford. I was also an undergrad at
                Stanford and I loved it so much that I didn't want to leave.

                Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with family, playing the guitar, going on outdoor excursions, and
                sleeping (which seems to be getting rarer and rarer these days). I also continue to maintain a foot in
                the start-up world by serving on advisory boards to various companies.</p>
